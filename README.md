### Inittab files
- **Ubuntu**
        - Back in the days **the "System-V" init service** was used in Ubuntu, and it used `/etc/inittab` file.
	
	- Some time ago (around 2006) **the "Upstart" init service** replaced System-V. Can use man inittab to get info.

	- Now **the "systemd" boot process is in use and there is no ref to things above. Use `man runlevel`
